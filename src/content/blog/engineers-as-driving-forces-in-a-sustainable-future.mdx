title: 'Engineers as Driving Forces in a Sustainable Future'
description: 'Engineers, as a unique group of influential stakeholders, hold significant power over consumers, companies, governments, and others. By fostering a mindset rooted in principles like sustainability by design and mastering the art of communication, they possess the potential to drive the systemic change needed to achieve our carbon budget goals.'

> This blog post is my cumulating reflection on "Total Sustainability Management" at McMaster University. It explores the role of engineers in driving systemic change toward a sustainable future.

### The Devastating Reality

The different industries and challenges covered throughout the group discussion reveal a recurring theme: despite our growing awareness, we fail to manage climate change and create a sustainable future in almost all industries. In fact, we are on track to exhaust our carbon budget, contributing to rising landfill waste and pollution. The reality of the situation is stark; if we are to meet our carbon budget on time, the effort required would need to be ten times greater than our current efforts. This will require unprecedented collaboration across industries and nations, regardless of their willingness. **Unfortunately, the fragmented efforts we currently see—whether from individuals, companies, industries, or countries—seem insufficient to make the required impact.** The barriers to change are huge, and no single stakeholder currently possesses the power to shift this norm.

When considering which group of stakeholders might have the power to drive systemic change, the answer is not so clear-cut. **Consumers**, while capable of influencing market demand, remain largely uninformed, easily manipulated, and limited in their choices. As consumers, we often lack access to critical information, leaving us vulnerable to deceptive practices. **Companies**, driven by profit and with investors to satisfy, face conflicts of interest that prevent them from prioritizing the environment over financial gains. For example, to promote long lifecycle clothing is apparently against the fast fashion company's goal for profit. **Governments**, though responsible for regulation, are often hindered by economic pressures and corruption. As William McDonough wrote in _A Boat for Thoreau_, "Regulations are signals of design failure." Strengthening regulations may solve surface-level issues but fails to address the underlying systemic problems. Other stakeholders, whether non-governmental organizations or industry leaders, often lack the broad influence needed to change the status quo.

### A New Driving Force

While traditional stakeholders face significant constraints, **engineers**, with their technical expertise and cross-disciplinary skills, hold a unique potential to bridge these gaps and drive systemic change.

Although not traditionally seen as central stakeholders, engineers across all industries could potentially become powerful voices of change if properly trained in environmental awareness. Engineers have a deep understanding of technology and systems. Many of them are 'multilingual', enabling them to bridge gaps between industries and stakeholders. If engineers were trained in industrial ecology and sustainability practices, they would be better equipped to integrate these principles into their design processes. **By embracing circular economy practices and collaborating across sectors, they could catalyze meaningful shifts in product and service design.**

Training engineers in environmental awareness has already shown promising results, with evidence suggesting that such training increases the adoption of sustainable practices[1]. By empowering engineers with knowledge about climate change and sustainability, we could gradually shift products and services toward more sustainable solutions. When engineers are committed to improving the environmental footprint of their designs, they can lead the way toward innovations that help reduce our reliance on detrimental practices.

In terms of the value chain, **Research & Development (R&D)** stands out as a critical area for driving change. This is where innovation occurs, and engineers have the opportunity to apply their environmental training to develop technologies and processes that minimize environmental impact. By incorporating sustainability metrics into the R&D phase, engineers can design solutions that align with sustainability goals from the outset. The potential for innovation in R&D, particularly in terms of reducing carbon emissions and waste, cannot be overstated. But it will take years, even for a generation of people, to have this mindset not to be such scarcity.

### Metrics for Success

As for metrics to measure success, two stand out: the **carbon budget** and **embodied carbon**. On a **macro** level, the **carbon budget** provides a clear and straightforward way to communicate progress toward climate change goals. It serves as a tangible measure of how much carbon we are allowed to emit before exceeding the planet's capacity to absorb it. This metric is widely understood and easy to communicate to a broad audience.

On a **micro** level, **embodied carbon** is an essential metric. This refers to the total carbon emissions associated with the production, transportation, and disposal of a product. By tracking embodied carbon, consumers can make more informed choices about the environmental impact of their purchases. Additionally, this metric serves as an indicator of technological progress—**whether new products are being designed with lower embodied carbon, and whether these products can be offset during their operational life**. Tracking embodied carbon offers both a way to hold industries accountable and a means to encourage innovation in the development of greener technologies.

### Final Words

"Do we truly care about the environment?" This question drove me to take this course. Too often, people discuss environmental issues passionately, only to return to unchanged routines. I don't blame anyone; it's human nature to prioritize immediate needs over challenges that don't feel critical to our daily lives. However, as engineers, we can create lasting change. True solutions aren't driven by guilt or "political correctness"—they should be profitable and natural. To me, this is the ultimate goal: **sustainability by design**.

Even the best designs, however, require collaboration to succeed. This is where sustainability management plays an essential role, ensuring these solutions are effectively communicated and implemented across organizations and industries. Clear, actionable messages and metrics are essential to resonate with different audiences, from local communities to executives. **The art of communication—aligning people toward a shared vision and inspiring action—is what truly drives meaningful change.**
